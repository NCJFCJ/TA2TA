Vera staff will lead interested OVW-funded TA providers through an interactive process of assessing the accessibility of their existing virtual events, and help them to incorporate best practices to ensure maximum accessibility of their future events. We will work with you on everything from assessing the accessibility of your virtual meeting platform, to taking a look at your registration questions, to planning to meet common accommodation requests, among other topics!Â </p>
<p>If you would like to participate in this FREE webinar accessibility review process, we ask that you complete a brief sign-up survey. You will be asked a few preliminary questions about your current virtual events.</p>
<p><strong>Please complete by Thursday, March 17th.</strong></p>
<p>Space is limited, and participation in the review process will be on a first come, first serve basis.Â </p>
