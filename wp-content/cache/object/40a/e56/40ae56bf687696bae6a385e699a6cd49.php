<p>To assist OVW in assessing the merits of grant applications, OVW uses active practitioners or recent retirees who possess subject matter expertise and experience addressing domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and/or stalking. OVW peer reviewers represent various professions and disciplines.</p>
<p>Each year, OVW conducts both in-person and online reviews. Peer reviews typically occur during the months of March and April.</p>
<p>To apply to be a peer reviewer for OVW, please access the OVW Peer Review Recruitment Form at http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/docs/peer-reviewer-info.pdf, and attach a copy of a resume, curriculum vitae or narrative highlighting your relevant domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, or stalking experience. All documents should be forwarded to OVW at ovw.peerreview@usdoj.gov.</p>
<p>Please note that technical assistance providers seeking to participate in peer review are prohibited from reviewing applications in specific OVW programs for which they provide training and technical assistance. Furthermore, OVW does not use "professional" peer reviewers, i.e. individuals whose substantive experience in our areas of interest is limited to the review of applications.</p>
<p>Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Program Assistant Ms. Tosha Preston at <a href="mailto:Tosha.Preston@usdoj.gov">Tosha.Preston@usdoj.gov</a>.</p>";s:10:"post_title";s:34:"OVW is Looking for Peer Reviewers!";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:33:"ovw-is-looking-for-peer-reviewers";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-01-17 21:17:13";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-01-17 21:17:13";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:57:"https://ldev.ta2ta.org/ovw-is-looking-for-peer-reviewers/";s:10:"menu_order";i:14;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
