In addition to the audio and visual recording of the live webinar, these rosters are provided to the TA provider presenting the live webinar for reporting purposes and for ensuring accessibility needs are met.

Adobe Connect has access to the name you log-in with, however, Adobe Connect does not have access to any other registration or attendee information and this information is not shared with Adobe Connect by TA2TA or the TA provider hosting the live webinar.
