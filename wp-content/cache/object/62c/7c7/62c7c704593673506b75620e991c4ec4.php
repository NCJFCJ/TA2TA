A-2	A Practical Approach to Recognizing, Evaluating, and Responding to Domestic Violence in Child Custody Disputes  					 	Loretta Frederick, Battered Women's Justice Project Gabrielle Davis, Battered Women's Justice Project  Survivors of domestic violence increasingly struggle to obtain from their family courts custody orders to protect themselves and their children from abuse.  Those represented by attorneys or supported by legal advocates can fare better than self-represented survivors but all face serious obstacles in their attempts to get protective, realistic parenting arrangements out of family court.  One solution is to be able to differentiate the nature, context and implications of the abuse &ndash; and to account for those differences in parenting arrangements.  This workshop introduces participants to a framework and a set of practical tools designed to help family court professionals recognize, evaluate and respond to domestic violence in child custody disputes.  A-3	The Power of Three: Strategies for Building an Effective and Supportive Lawyer/Advocate Collaboration with Clients     Kristen Beattie, Domestic Violence Program at Community Action of Greene County Jeanne Noordsy, Domestic Violence Project of Catholic Charities Zoe Paolantonio, Legal Aid Society of Northeastern New York Michaela Sarofeen, Legal Aid Society of Northeastern New York  A strong attorney/advocate relationship can be a powerful tool in our work assisting victims and survivors. This workshop will focus on strategies for developing the attorney/advocate relationship, and examples of what an effective lawyer/advocate team can accomplish both on behalf of individual clients and towards organizing the broader response to domestic violence and sexual assault in our communities.  Daily relationships build shared vision and values for powerful collaboration.  A-4	Helping Survivors Navigate a Campus Resolution Process	 Lindy Aldrich, Victims&rsquo; Rights Law Center  Colleges and universities that receive federal funding have an obligation to comply with Title IX when responding to gender-based harassment. Whether it is a single incident or an ongoing pattern of abuse, sexual assault or harassment can undermine a victim&rsquo;s physical and emotional safety. In order to remedy a hostile environment, campuses must provide survivors with safety and remedial measures and the option to participate in their resolution/conduct process. This workshop will provide participants with detailed practice tips on where to begin to with a new campus case, how to assist a survivor with obtaining the safety and remedial measures they need, and the ways to prepare and assist a survivor throughout all stages of the resolution process.  A-5   Addressing Violence Against Native Americans and Alaskan Natives: How to Leverage Existing Resources in Advocating for Tribal Clients Michelle Demmert, Office of the Tulalip Tribes Reservation  During this workshop, we will discuss setting up a legal aid program for Native communities by utilizing existing non-Native models to include discussion about important considerations.  In this process, we will discuss how to collaborate and involve civil/criminal justice system and community professionals to improve survivor resources. In addition, we will discuss and identify other federally-funded organizations that provide resources to use to develop creative solutions for victims." width="1410" height="2250" /></td>
