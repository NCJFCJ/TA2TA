The primary purpose of the OVW Training and Technical Assistance Initiative is to provide direct technical assistance and training to OVW grantees, partners, sub-grantees, and potential grantees to enhance and support their efforts to successfully implement projects supported by OVW grant funds. This four-part OVW TA Orientation provides new OVW TA providers and new project staff of existing OVW TA projects with information to support and foster their capacity as TA providers to carry out their projects.
