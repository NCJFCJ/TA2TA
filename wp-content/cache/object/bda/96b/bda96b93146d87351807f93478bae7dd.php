The Technical Assistance Program provides OVW grantees with the training, expertise, and problem-solving strategies they need to meet the challenges of addressing sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. OVWâ€™s technical assistance projects offer in-person and online educational opportunities, peer-to-peer consultations, site visits, and tailored assistance for OVW grantees, subgrantees, and potential grantees. The TA2TA Project was designed to address challenges and foster opportunities for OVW technical assistance providers to enhance their capacity to meet the needs of OVW grantees and subgrantees.
