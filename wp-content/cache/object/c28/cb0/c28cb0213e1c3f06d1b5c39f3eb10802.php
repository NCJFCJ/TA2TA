This information is primarily collected for statistical analysis and technical improvements to the site. This government computer system uses software programs to create summary statistics, which may be used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. In certain circumstances, however, we may take additional steps to identify you based on this information and we may share this information, including your identity, with the Office on Violence Against Women.</p>

<h3>Personal Information That You Voluntarily Provide</h3>
<p style="marin-left: 30px;">You do not have to provide any personal information to us to access information on our websites. If you choose to provide us with personal information, such as by sending a message to an e-mail address on this website or by filling out a form and submitting it through our website, we will use that information to respond to your message or to fulfill the stated purpose of the communication. The NCJFCJ and OVW do not collect or use information for commercial marketing.</p>
<p style="marin-left: 30px;">We may share information you give us with OVW if your inquiry relates to that agency.
