This workshop will include a discussion of the legal needs of trafficking victims, how to issue spot trafficking during intake and during representation, and best practices in community collaboration to effectively provide legal services to domestic violence and sexual assault victims of human trafficking. 	 D-2	Engaging Men: Men Stopping Violence&rsquo;s Organizing Model to End Male Violence Against Women  	 	Greg Loughlin, Men Stopping Violence  Men Stopping Violence&rsquo;s (MSV) mission is to organize men to end male violence against women and girls through innovative trainings, programs, and advocacy.  An important component of our mission is to incorporate organizing practices into our programs that lay the foundation for all men to become anti-violence against women advocates and to play important roles in transforming whole communities.  In this workshop we will discuss the basics of organizing and engaging men, outline our organizing practices within our Men at Work class and Because We Have Daughters program, and demonstrate our success through highlighting the Community Restoration Program, MSV&rsquo;s volunteer wing for men who have  completed the 24-week Men at Work class.  D-3	Should I Stay or Should I Go? Helping Survivors with Interstate Custody and Relocation Cases Deborah Goelman, Legal Resource Center on Violence Against Women Aime Lewis, Legal Resource Center on Violence Against Women Darren Mitchell, Consultant Sarah Whitesell, Legal Resource Center on Violence Against Women  Have domestic violence survivors ever asked you if they can leave the state with their children to escape from abuse?  The Legal Resource Center on Violence Against Women (LRC) will provide a brief introduction to attorneys and advocates on interstate custody and domestic violence laws and practice.  This  workshop will provide participants with an overview of the services available from the LRC and introduce them to the safety and legal issues involved when survivors cross state lines with their children.  Participants will learn about the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) and related laws.    D-4	Working With Survivors When Abusers Misuse Technology Kaofeng Lee, National Network to End Domestic Violence  Perpetrators of stalking and domestic violence are often ahead of the curve on the use of technology to abuse, harass, and control their victims. Understanding how technology is misused is crucial to both supporting victims and holding offenders accountable. This workshop will discuss how abusers misuse technology to harm victims and offer resources and information on how practitioners can work with survivors experiencing technology abuse.  D-5	Be the Light at the End of the Tunnel: How to Effectively Serve Immigrant Survivors Released from Family Detention Leslye Orloff, the National Immigrant Women&rsquo;s Advocacy Project at the  American University, Washington College of Law  Archi Pyati,  Tahirih Justice Center  When immigrant mothers and their children who are survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking and abuse flee their home countries seeking safety in the United States, many suffer harrowing journeys to the U.S. and then are detained at Family Detention Centers by DHS. Upon release, these mothers and their children resettle in communities across the country where their ability to receive victim and legal services can make the difference between achieving safety and healing or being deported. This workshop will help participants meet the needs of mothers and children released from detention who can be particularly vulnerable to becoming victims of domestic and sexual violence in the U.S.  Participants  will learn how they can provide trauma informed help in immigration matters (asylum, VAWA, T, U, SIJS) and how to help survivors access the housing, healthcare, mental health care, child care, and victim services they and their children need and are legally entitled to receive." width="1410" height="2250" /></td>
