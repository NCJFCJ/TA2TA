<p>The primary purpose of the OVW Training and Technical Assistance Initiative is to provide direct technical assistance to OVW grantees, partners, sub-grantees, and potential grantees to enhance and support their efforts to successfully implement projects supported by OVW grant funds. TA2TA is an OVW TA project that maintains a website that includes a directory of TA projects, a library of OVW-funded resources, and a calendar of upcoming training and webinar events. This webinar will provide an overview of the website and how it can be of use to you.</p>";s:10:"post_title";s:47:"Connecting OVW Grantees to Technical Assistance";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:49:"connecting-ovw-grantees-to-technical-assistance-2";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2020-05-19 22:03:10";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2020-05-19 22:03:10";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:73:"https://ldev.ta2ta.org/connecting-ovw-grantees-to-technical-assistance-2/";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
