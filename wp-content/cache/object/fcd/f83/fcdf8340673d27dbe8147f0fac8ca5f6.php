Through legal/policy and judicial perspectives, this workshop will provide participants with an opportunity to identify challenges and explore strategies for protecting survivors and their children through civil orders.  C-2	Advocating for Young Survivors     Alexandrea Scott, Breaking the Cycle   This workshop will focus on how dating abuse affects teens differently from adults. Participants will learn how to define dating abuse, improve their understanding of its dynamics, and explore the key influences of dating abuse among teens.  Participants will also learn common legal issues to consider when working with young survivors of abuse and how to safely promote disclosure of teen dating abuse. Participants should walk away from the workshop feeling better equipped to work with teens, and even look forward to it!   C-3	Trauma Informed, Victim-Defined:  Practice Issues for Lawyers Jill Davies, Greater Harford Legal Aid, Inc.  &ldquo;Trauma-informed&rdquo; and &ldquo;victim-defined&rdquo; are commonly used to describe advocacy with survivors of violence, but what do they mean in the context of legal practice? This workshop will explore how a client experiencing the effects of trauma affects legal representation. Topics will include: attorney-client relationship, when trauma is germane to the case, assessing credibility, negotiation preparation, and secondary traumatic stress. The framework of victim/client-defined representation will also be discussed.  C-4	Sexual Assault and the Military     C.
